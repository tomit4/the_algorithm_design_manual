Q: The <em>set cover problem</em> is as follows: give a set of subsets
$S_1,...,S_m$ of the universal set $U = {1,...,n}$, find the smallest subset of
subsets $T \subset S$ such that $\cup_{t_i \in T}t_i = U$. For example, there
are the following subsets, $S_1 = {1,3,5}, S_2 = {2,4}, S_3 = {1,4}, and S_4 =
{2,5}$ The set cover would then be $S_1$ and $S_2$. Find a counterexample for
the following algorithm: Select the largest subset for the cover, and then
delete all its elements from the universal set. Repeat by adding the subset
containing the largest number of uncovered elements until all are covered.
