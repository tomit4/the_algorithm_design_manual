Q: The <em>knapsack problem</em> is as follows: given a set of integers $S =
{s_1,s_2,...s_n}$, and a target number $T$, find a subset of $S$ which adds up
exactly to $T$. For example, there exists a subset within $S = {1,2,5,9,10}$
that adds up to $T = 22$ but not $T = 23$.

Find counterexamples to each of the following algorithms for the knapsack
problem. That is, giving an $S$ and $T$ such that the subset is selected using
the algorithm does not leave the knapsack completely full, even though such a
solution exists.

(a) Put the elements of $S$ in the knapsack in left to right order if they fit,
i.e. the first-fit algorithm.

(b) Put the elements of $S$ in the knapsack from smallest to largest; i.e. the
best-fit algorithm.

(c) Put the elements of $S$ in the knapsack from largest to smallest.

A:
